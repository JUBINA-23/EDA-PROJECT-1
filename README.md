Tourism Management
This dataset contains data on tourism management, with a focus on resource allocation and service delivery at various tourist destinations. The dataset includes information on visitor counts, environmental factors, resource type and availability, visitor reviews and other key indicators that affect tourist experiences. The purpose of this dataset is to support the optimization of resource allocation, improve service delivery, and enhance the tourist experience.

The analysis of the Tourism Resource Allocation Management dataset gives a comprehensive understanding of visitor behavior, resource availability, environmental conditions and ratings at 3 different tourist locations. By examining variations in visitor counts, stay durations and ratings, we come across patterns that reflect how different factors like weather, resource availability and overcrowding shape tourist experiences.

Our project summarizes that visitor counts fluctuate significantly depending on weather conditions and resource availability, with certain locations experiencing peak visits that strain resources and contribute to overcrowding. We observed that locations with better managed resources such as restrooms, food stalls and parking spaces, tend to attract more visitors and receive higher ratings. Ratings provided by visitors revealed clear correlations with factors like resource availability, overcrowding and environmental conditions. However, overcrowding remains a challenge, especially during peak visit periods where demand often exceeds resource capacity. 

By identifying these patterns, we now have a clearer understanding of what drives increase in visitor numbers, how resources are utilized and what factors contribute to higher ratings.
